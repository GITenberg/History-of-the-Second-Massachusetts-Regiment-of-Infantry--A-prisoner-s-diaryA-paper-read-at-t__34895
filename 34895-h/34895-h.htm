<h2>A PRISONER&rsquo;S DIARY.</h2>


<p>The committee&rsquo;s announcement, that on this evening
there would be read by me a paper relating to the history of
the regiment, I fear may have awakened false expectations.
But it was suggested that a little personal history of my own
experiences, from the moment when that terrific flank fire
caused the regiment to leave me for dead on the field of
Cedar Mountain to the moment when, three months later,
I again came under the stars and stripes at Aiken&rsquo;s Landing,
would interest former comrades for a short time to-night.
It is safe to say, perhaps, that our regiment passed through
every possible experience of the war. In all the various
scenes of suffering and endurance, both physical and mental,
which the war could offer, the Second Massachusetts
was represented; and in that view, perhaps, the personal
adventures of those who, while separated from the corps,
always considered its membership the highest of honors,
may be considered as forming part of the general history of
the regiment itself.</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to find in my blouse pocket, after
acute physical suffering had in a measure given place to the
prisoner&rsquo;s worst enemy, the leaden vacuity of ennui, a little
duodecimo almanac and diary for 1862, with half a lead
pencil. With these, by dint of fine writing, I succeeded in
keeping a sort of journal of daily events, with my reflections
thereupon, during the whole period of my captivity, the last
entry being comprised in the words, &ldquo;<i>A free man at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
Willard&rsquo;s</i>.&rdquo; From this journal, I shall make copious extracts,
believing that words then written will reproduce the situation
better than any subsequent description from memory.</p>

<p>At about 2 P.M. on the 8th of August, the long roll was
beaten in the camp of the Second Massachusetts, at Little
Washington. As has often happened, we fell in only to fall
out again with the news that it only meant get ready to
march; and in fact it was nearly five before we were off.
The heat during the first hour or two of the march was
severe, but the latter part was by moonlight and very pleasant.
Still, I find it recorded that some unfortunate and
unseasoned recruits, who had just joined us from home with
knapsacks heavy with five times what they really needed,
were utterly played out before the sun was down. And
here I take up the narration as I find it in the little book
referred to, with an occasional interpolation and explanation
which will be marked as such in brackets.</p>

<p><i>August 14, 1862.</i>&mdash;One week to-day since the fight. Let
us attempt a <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i>. On arriving at Culpeper, Friday night,
after a moonlight march which about played out the unfortunate
recruits with their heavy knapsacks, we lay down in a
field, Stephen and I cracking my provision box, which had
come on with the blankets. [This was Lieutenant Stephen
Perkins of Company A with whom I had become intimate,
and who shared with me a great and innocent passion for
tea. Whichever of us was known to possess a supply of the
article was sure of a visit from the other at his camp fire
after a march. Before separating that night, I remember he
said to me, &ldquo;Sam, we shall see more fighting soon: I feel
it; there is a battle in the air.&rdquo; There was, indeed, and it
ended the battle of life for him.] We then slept on the
moor, to the sound of freshly arriving troops and wagons.
In the morning, we find an army around us. After a breakfast
at the sound of the triangle [for by this unmilitary instrument
did Johnson, our caterer, call the officers&rsquo; mess to meals],
under the sun, we fall in and take arms, but have hardly
done so when we stack them again and proceed to stake out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
ground for a camp. But this is just done and tents beginning
to rise when Sherman, of Pope&rsquo;s staff, rushes by to
head-quarters at a rate which &ldquo;spared not for spoiling of his
steed,&rdquo; and which caused us to hold our hands in expectation
for a moment; and, sure enough, in two minutes we were
again in line, and this time off under a blazing sun, though
for once without our knapsacks. Through Culpeper and
about six or seven miles further in a fiery furnace hotter
even than that of Shadrach &amp; Co. Near the front, heard a
little firing. Sergeant Parsons fell with sun-stroke. Left
two recruits with him and pushed on for the right, where
at last, panting and half dead, we got into a wood where we
stacked arms and fell down behind them. The half hour of
breeze and shade which ensued made men of us once more,
so that when my company was ordered to skirmish we were
actually able to do it. The firing of artillery commenced at
about 3 P.M., as I should judge, pretty heavy and well-sustained.
Ned Abbott&rsquo;s company and mine were ordered to
report forward, and deployed our skirmishers on the garden
fence, with reserves behind; and there, for a couple of hours,
we watched the swayings of the artillery fight, timing the
explosion of the heavy shells, and watching the varying
intervals between the shots of the rebel batteries. At last,
as the sun seemed not more than an hour high, and just as
Ned Abbott, lying by my side in the rear of our skirmishers,
had expressed his disbelief in the fight&rsquo;s coming off that
afternoon, an orderly, followed by Pitman of Banks&rsquo; staff,
came up to where Gordon was sitting on his horse near us,
watching the field through his glass; and it seemed, for the
first time, that something was going wrong. I was near
enough to hear that he wanted a regiment of Gordon&rsquo;s brigade
to report, as I understood it, to Banks at the centre.
&ldquo;You must take him your regiment, then,&rdquo; said Gordon to
Colonel Andrews. Abbott and I jumped to our feet, and were
ordered to rally our men on the battalion; and hardly, panting
and breathless, had we resumed our places in line when
the regiment advanced by the right of companies to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
front, until we had cleared the garden, and then by company
into line.</p>

<p>Then commenced the furious and incessant roll and crash
of musketry, leaving, as Copeland expressed it, no interval
in which a single other shot could have been inserted. We
plunged over the ditch and crashed through a wood, out of
which came Crane of the Third Wisconsin, covered with
blood, and reeling in his saddle, until after about a quarter
of a mile we came to a fence with a wheat-field beyond. In
this, a brigade of rebels were in line, but what they were
firing at we couldn&rsquo;t see. We opened fire and then were
ordered to cease&mdash;why, I don&rsquo;t know, as I could see no
one between us and them. But, as their line advanced, we
soon re-opened fire, as the converging storm of balls hailed
upon us.</p>

<p>How long this lasted, I could not tell. Their red flags
advanced, but large gaps were opening in their lines.
Finally, the bullets seemed to come from all sides at once.
Pattison, my lieutenant, shouted in my ear that Cary was
down, and he had been ordered to take his company; and
he left. Then the red flags seemed close upon the fence,
and it seemed to me that the right had fallen back; and I
started across the little gap in the fence to see. Yes, the
right had gone; but in that instant I caught it, first in the
right leg, then through the left foot, and in that same instant
the enemy were upon us, or rather upon me, for what
was left of my company had gone with the rest. Though
staggering, I had not yet fallen, when one rushed up, aimed
at my head with &ldquo;Surrender, G&mdash;d d&mdash;n your soul!&rdquo; which
I did. But if I had known then, what now I know, I
would have lain there for dead till they were gone, and then
dragged myself slowly toward our side. [This refers to the
fact that one of the first pleasing pieces of information
communicated to me by my captors, who were surprised
that I did not already know it, was that, by special orders
of Jeff. Davis, none of Pope&rsquo;s officers were to be treated
as prisoners of war or paroled, but kept as hostages to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
hanged from time to time in retaliation for any such execution
of guerrillas as was threatened in Pope&rsquo;s celebrated
orders, of which we then had not yet heard.]</p>

<p>But as it was [the journal resumes], I gave up my sword
and pistol, sat down, borrowed my captor&rsquo;s knife, ripped my
trousers open and shoe off, and examined damages. An
awful hole in foot and little one in leg, at the bottom of
which the bullet was plainly visible. Seeing this, the Confederate
gentleman to whom I then belonged was seized
with a desire to perform a surgical operation with the knife
referred to, but yielded to my remonstrance and request
that he would be satisfied with having put it in, and allow
some gentleman of the medical staff to undertake the bullet&rsquo;s
extraction. Two of them then offered to take me across
the wheat-field to where their own wounded were, asking
me at the same time what money I had for them. They
did not offer any violence or undertake to search me. Had
they done so, they would have made prize of my money-belt,
containing over $90 in greenbacks and a gold watch. I
gave them some ten or twelve gold dollars which I had
in my pocket, reserving one by great good luck, as will
presently appear. Then they carried me across the field,
with each arm affectionately round a rebel neck. As I
passed the fence where the right had been, there lay poor
Ned,&mdash;who half an hour before had joked about being two
hours in action without losing a man,&mdash;with white, waxen
face against the dead leaves. It was just light enough for
me to recognize him. Who else of the officers had fallen,
I did not know, save that Cary was down, as Pattison had
told me, before our lines gave way. With occasional halts,
they carried me across the field, and put me down among a
groaning mass of wounded of both sides. The men next me
gave me water and a knapsack for my head, a man came along
with a canteen of whiskey and I got a drink. The moon rose
full over the trees, and the cannonade recommenced. I got
a piece of the wounded rebel&rsquo;s blanket next me over my
shoulder, lay as near him as I could; for, though the day had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
been blazing, the night mist and loss of blood made me
shiver; and I slept. Once I was waked by some one attempting
to pull off my seal ring; but he desisted when I
pulled my hand away, remarked, &ldquo;A handsome ring,&rdquo; and
went on. Very likely he thought me dead, as my companion
under the blanket was by that time.</p>

<p>Before daylight, the pain of my shattered bones brought
me again to consciousness. Somehow, I hated to see the
sky begin to brighten, knowing how soon the sun would blaze
furiously down upon us. And yet I didn&rsquo;t seem to realize
the horrors of the position, but looked upon myself as acting
a part for which I had expected to be cast, and with the
stage business of which I was perfectly familiar; and all
the wounded took it more or less as a business matter. As
the sun rose, I gradually dragged myself under trees with the
rest of the groaning set, leaving those who had died to sleep
it out. A rebel soldier passed with two canteens on.
&ldquo;What will you sell me one of those canteens for?&rdquo; said
I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a dollar.&rdquo; He laughed and was passing
on. &ldquo;A gold dollar,&rdquo; said I. He stopped: &ldquo;What, Yank!
Have you got a gold dollar?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you go to
the branch, fill the canteen with fresh water, and here&rsquo;s
the dollar.&rdquo; If he had been a wretch, he might have taken
it away and left me to die, for there was no one else near
except wounded; but, after considering a few minutes, he
went off to the stream, filled the canteen, brought it to me,
took the dollar, and left. And that canteen, I think, saved
my life; for soon the sun rose so that no more shade could
be had. I tore up my handkerchief, bound my wounds, and
kept them moist, kept the canteen under me and took little
sips when my thirst became unbearable, and so got through
the day, making the water last until evening. By and by,
they began to pick up the wounded by threes and pairs, in
ambulances. When, however,&mdash;I should think about 3 P.M.,&mdash;there
were about five or six of us left, and I the only Yankee,
a sudden rush of men through the woods and stampede
of wagons down the road, with an accompaniment of &ldquo;Yankees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
are coming!&rdquo; swept every sound man away from us.
Every man that had legs used them at double quick. Then
the prayers of the wounded to the wagoners, as they flogged
their teams past: &ldquo;Oh, take me away from here, help me
into a wagon; for God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t leave me to the Yankees!&rdquo;
One poor fellow, all of whose clothes had been taken
off by the surgeon engaged on his wounds, raised himself,
stark naked and covered with blood, against a tree, and implored
every teamster in turn to stop and take him in.
The effect was grisly. It struck me that, if they were
really coming, some of the rebs then rushing by might take
occasion to settle one Yankee &ldquo;<i>en passant</i>&rdquo;: so I got my
blouse off, covered myself with dead rebel sergeant&rsquo;s coat,
and lay low. A section of artillery extricated itself from
the wagons, and wheeled into battery; and, finding myself
just in point-blank range, I succeeded by painful endeavor
in getting behind a big stump.</p>

<p>But, alas! the excitement subsided, the wagons were
stopped and ordered back, officers cursed the originators of
the panic, and it was all over. But a real charge or a few
shots just then would have started &ldquo;secesh&rdquo; with a rush,
and saved the captain of Company E, Second Massachusetts
Volunteers. After awhile, an ambulance came and picked
up the last two of us and carried us to where the hospital
flies were pitched. My driver, after making sure that nobody
heard him, informed me that he had always been for the
Union, and voted against &ldquo;secesh&rdquo;; &ldquo;and when they started
this war,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I swore they&rsquo;d have to fight it out without
me; but I was wrong there, for they&rsquo;ve got me.&rdquo; He
drove me up to a fly under which were some dozen or twenty
wounded on hospital cots. At first, they said there was no
room; but then somebody discovered that his neighbor was
dead, and suggested that the Yankee might take his place.
So they moved the dead man out under the eaves inside the
guys, and gave me the cot. The surgeon examined and
bound up my foot, relieving me with the assurance that it
would probably stay on, though I should be always lame.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
The bullet came out of my leg very easily, for, oddly
enough, it hadn&rsquo;t pierced my drawers, but had carried them
deep into the leg in a sort of bag. A thunder-storm now
burst upon us, and with the first gust down came our house,
over living and dead. After a long staggering and flapping,
they got her set again. The rain thundered on the canvas
and cascaded in sheets over the dead man under the eaves,
but he was beyond even water cure. The scene was dismal:
in the intervals of rain, they took to burying legs and arms
upon the hill, and it would not have made a bad slide for a
stereoscope, on the whole. But, as night fell, I took my
supper with some relish,&mdash;a piece of hard-tack and ham,
given me by a rebel private on the field,&mdash;and with the help
of the dead rebel&rsquo;s blanket of last night, which I had sense
enough to bag when they picked me up, I slept once more.</p>

<p>In the morning, they sent me in an ambulance or &ldquo;avalanche,&rdquo;
as they call it, to head-quarters. Thought at first
I was going before Felix or Stonewall himself; turned out
to be General Hill. He came and looked into the ambulance.
&ldquo;What regiment?&rdquo; &ldquo;Second Massachusetts.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, Gordon&rsquo;s old regiment?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Best regiment
in Banks&rsquo; army; cut all to pieces, though: I&rsquo;ve been
over the ground,&rdquo; and exit. He ordered me sent to Orange
Court House; countermanded, and they dumped me out by
a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop. A surgeon came along and ordered
me sent to Rapidan Station, on the box seat of an &ldquo;avalanche&rdquo;;
and an awful &ldquo;avalanche&rdquo; it was,&mdash;four men with
legs and arms off inside. It was eight miles over rocks and
through rivers, and generally such a drive of damnation as
never entered into the heart of man to conceive. Luckily,
I kept my strength; but why the inside passengers didn&rsquo;t
die before we got half way is the marvel. &ldquo;The lamentable
chorus, the cry of agony, the endless groan,&rdquo; as we
bounced and jolted over corduroy road and river bed, was
an ill thing to hear. We arrived at the railroad about
dusk, just as I was calculating about how much longer I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
could stand it without fainting, and they put us out on the
grass among those already arrived. The train came along
after dark, and, finding that I must shift for myself or be
left in the field, I made my painful way on hands and knees,
among horses&rsquo; feet and under the awful &ldquo;avalanche,&rdquo; to the
platform, where, after a while, they picked me up and put
me aboard; turned seat back, put my foot up, and slept.</p>

<p>An interval of broken oblivion in the dark car, with
occasional wakings to a semi-consciousness of rumbling
wheels, brakes, and once familiar railroad sounds, mingled
strangely with groans, cries, stench, squalor, and misery.
But, as the night was only a succession of frightful dreams,
I didn&rsquo;t undertake to decide which was reality, but took the
benefit of the doubt, which was a species of relief. But with
the gray dawn illusions vanished, and the miserable reality
stood out, bald and unmistakable. Where we were going, I
didn&rsquo;t know; but after a while the impression seemed to
prevail that it wasn&rsquo;t Richmond, but Staunton; and at
about twelve we arrived here. The train at once became a
menagerie, wherein the Yankee wild beasts were stirred up
and stared at by the town. One citizen, I remember, was
turned out of the car by a rebel sergeant for insulting the
prisoners. They took us out at last, one or two rebs who
had died in the night being first served. Finally, about
evening, they took the two Yankee captains, in almost an
upside-down position, with heads in straw and feet in air,
through the town to the hospital, women coming to the windows
with various expressions of countenance, pity being
the scarcest. I&rsquo;ve often seen them look out to see soldiers
pass, but never expected to figure in this sort of a pageant
for their edification.</p>

<p>[The reflections and moralizings on my situation, which
follow, it was my first impulse to omit from this paper
entirely; but on the whole I decide to let them stand as
I find them, requesting only that comrades will consider
them as given in a sort of family confidence.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
Of my life, if life it may be called [continues the diary], in
this place, I desire to make no record, the <i>olim haec meminisse</i>
principle having no application here. Let the waters
of oblivion cover it forever, if I am ever again a free man.
To lie a crippled and helpless butt for the exulting Philistine
and his women ten thousand times worse than himself,
while such tremendous history is being made of which we
can only guess at the reality, is a living death. And with
such a companion! What is happening behind the impenetrable
curtain between us and the North? Until the
news that God has abdicated and Satan reigns is confirmed
beyond a peradventure, so long will I believe that the right
will triumph in the end. But where the end may be, this
year or twenty hence, <i>quien sabe</i>?</p>

<p>Of my own chances for life and liberty, I cannot even
guess. The blackness of darkness surrounds me on every
hand, with no perceptible ray or glimmer from any quarter, as
yet. But, doubtless, many a man who thinks he sees his
path of life stretching away in far perspective is really as
blind as I, and can discern no further beyond his nose.
When the tide of war shall turn, as turn it will, what will
be done with us? where shall I be,&mdash;here or in the Libby?
Well, each place has its merits: here, enough to eat and
no bracelets; there, the company of gentlemen. Oh Harry
Russell! if you and I were together to cheer each other
with regimental chat, or gallant Major Jim, <i>sans peur et
sans reproche</i>, in your company I could suffer and be
strong unto the end. But I fear that, through desperate
wounds, his mortal body has had no longer strength to
retain the soul of one of the bravest Christian gentlemen
that ever drew sword for the right since the world began.</p>

<p>And Stephen, my friend, man of culture, reading, and intellect,
whose only complaint of camp life was the loss of
time and opportunity for the growth of mind,&mdash;that such
lights should be forever extinguished by the bullets of men
so few degrees above the brute level, saddens the soul. And
shall all this have been in vain? Answer, freemen and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
gentlemen of the North, with unborn generations waiting: to
bless or curse your memory,&mdash;answer now!</p>

<p>[The above allusion to &ldquo;no bracelets&rdquo; refers to the assertion
of a Richmond paper, immediately communicated to us
by way of cheering our spirits, that Pope&rsquo;s officers, on arriving
at the Libby, had all been handcuffed. But, although
this proved to be erroneous, yet my own boast of no bracelets
in the hospital was somewhat premature, as the following incident
will show. One evening after supper, just as a half-drunk
rebel officer had become so abusive to us that I almost
expected the cowardice of a blow, entered the sergeant of
the guard, who put a stop to that fun, but, to our great disgust,
after the officer had gone, produced a pair of handcuffs,
which he informed us he was ordered to apply to &ldquo;that Yankee,&rdquo;
indicating Captain Bush of the Twenty-eighth New
York, who, being wounded in the arm, was walking up and
down the room, which no one else was able to do. (This officer,
by the way, had voluntarily accompanied his regiment
into action, armed with a cane, being under arrest and deprived
of his sword.) His wound was severe, and the surgeon
had expressed doubts of saving the arm. We all remonstrated
against the barbarity of handcuffing the only
man whom it would really hurt. No use: he had got his orders,
and on went the irons. Bush didn&rsquo;t say a word, but,
after the sergeant had gone, with a sharp stick which his
neighbor whittled out for him, and a piece of string poked
into the lock of the handcuff, succeeding in pulling back the
catch, and slipped one wrist out. The other, he didn&rsquo;t mind.
Before the ward surgeon came round the next morning, he
slipped it in again. The surgeon was indignant,&mdash;not at
the barbarity, but at the interference with his case,&mdash;and
off he rushed to the surgeon in command, to have the handcuffs
removed. But all he obtained was an order that Bush
be sent to Richmond, handcuffs and all. We heard, however,
that the ward surgeon had them removed as soon as Bush
was clear of the hospital yard.</p>

<p>The story we heard, probably true, was that Hay, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
medical director in command, reading the account of the
Richmond handcuffing, one night when he was tight, was
fired with the idea of emulating such a noble example, and
ordered the bracelets to be applied at once to any Yankee
who was well enough to be walking about. Even our visitors
were rather ashamed of this performance, and invented
an absurd story that Bush had tried to escape,&mdash;a man with
a shattered arm trying to escape from the only chance of
saving it!]</p>

<p>[Journal resumed.] It seems that an opportunity may turn
up for sending this little book off to the North by a man
who will shortly get his parole, and I think will undertake
to smuggle it through. These jottings have been almost
my only resource to pass away the leaden hours. With no
companion to whom I can open my soul, I must soliloquize,
if only to convince myself that I have not yet sunk to the
level of my surroundings.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, September 20.</i>&mdash;Six weeks to-day since the fight
in which we became dead to the world. &ldquo;Hope springs
eternal,&rdquo; etc. If it didn&rsquo;t, how many would turn their
faces to the wall! One man got his everlasting furlough
the other day, just at supper time; but they pulled the
sheet over his face and went on with the bread and molasses;
and, when that was over, down he went to the
dead-house.</p>

<p>This, in my opinion, is for the country the very moment
of convulsion and travail, out of which some new state of
things,&mdash;the commencement of some new era,&mdash;for better
or for worse, will surely come. &ldquo;When the pain is sorest,
the child is born; and the night is darkest before the
dawn of the day of the Lord at hand.&rdquo; But at this critical
moment to be walled up alive, where only faint echoes and
uncertain sounds from the great fields reach us,&mdash;the fields
where our fellow-soldiers are playing out the great game
of the age is,&mdash;a chance of war, and nothing to complain
of while we still live. A great battle has been in Maryland,
and, although they make it out that we were worsted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
yet from signs and tokens we draw our own inferences.
First and greatest, the women haven&rsquo;t been up to crow
victory over the Yankee prisoners, <i>ergo</i> the first despatch
did not announce a success; the doctors have said nothing,
and last night Dr. Hay, with a dozen others and all the
dressers that could be spared, left for Maryland. Charley,
the nigger, yesterday reported that the folks in town felt
very bad about it. Reports fly about of fifty thousand killed
and wounded on both sides; and, as they can&rsquo;t know ours,
theirs must have been tremendous to have started such
reports. (Here come the women to the menagerie.) At
all events, it&rsquo;s such a victory as they can&rsquo;t stand a repetition
of; and now, if the North will pour in reinforcements, there
may be a glimmer of daylight for the cause, if not for me.</p>

<p>A man has come into this room, wounded at Port Republic,
First Sergeant Seventh Ohio, the most awful specimen of
emaciation that I ever saw or would have believed consistent
with the vital spark. The articulation of each joint, covered
only by the tense polished skin, is as distinct as in a skeleton.</p>

<p>Another horror: a rebel deserter, who was put in with the
Yankees in order to be under guard, has just been sheared,
on account of one of the plagues of Egypt; and his head was
a sight to dream of, not to tell. He had been living in the
woods since he deserted, was immediately taken down with
typhoid fever, and I thought wanted to die.</p>

<p>The room now consists as follows, beginning with my next
neighbor: Corporal James Shipp, known as Jimmy, the pet
of the room, doctors and nurses inclusive: a nice, simple-hearted
boy of seventeen, brave and good; shot in shoulder,
scapula taken out; recovering. Private Smith, Forty-sixth
Pennsylvania: good fellow, apparently; has taken laudanum
enough to float a ship, and seems to be getting fat on it.</p>

<p>The skeleton sergeant comes next. He keeps a journal,
and his wound drives me from the room, whenever opened.</p>

<p>The deserter and company. He wouldn&rsquo;t have needed
John Ph&oelig;nix&rsquo;s tape-worm, in order to use the editorial &ldquo;we.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A bragging squirt of a Georgian, who got scratched in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
finger in Maryland, and marched all the way here to save his
precious hide and boast of the Yankees he had killed.</p>

<p>George Peet, Fifth Ohio: a good young fellow; lost his
foot the other day, after six weeks trying to save it.</p>

<p>Henry Shaw, One Hundred and Second New York: a
little, white-headed Harlemite, a little conceited; talks a
little better English than the rest of them; shot in back;
recovering.</p>

<p>Arthur Jordan, Tenth Maine: obliging, pleasant, nice fellow;
had the measles, and was sent to the &ldquo;measly ward,&rdquo;
from which he has just made his escape on his own hook,
returning here at the risk of being put in the guard-house.</p>

<p>Sergeant Henry Holloway, Fifth Connecticut: the only
one with whom I can fraternize at all; a railroad man, engine
driver, etc., infected with the insubordinate ideas natural to
his regiment; otherwise, a good fellow.</p>

<p>Captain &mdash;&mdash;, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, selfishness incarnate. It takes
all sorts of men to make up a world, but let us hope that
it takes few such as he.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, September 25.</i>&mdash;Great news in yesterday&rsquo;s paper.
It seems Pope&rsquo;s officers have been paroled. That is a glimmer
of daylight, and looks as if the winter might not be
passed in shop ward No. 7, or the Libby. General Prince is
courteously alluded to as &ldquo;the ringleader of the gang.&rdquo; For
pure malignity of venom, these Richmond editors would beat
even the witches&rsquo; toad that was stewed after his month&rsquo;s nap
under the stone.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 28th.</i>&mdash;Away with visions of home and ease!
Wilder Dwight has been killed, and I am Major, I suppose....
Now to play the man and be prepared to go to the majority
in either sense, when God&rsquo;s will is.</p>

<p>Just had a visit from Joshua Munroe,&mdash;and a cheering visit,
indeed,&mdash;a descendant of Israel Munroe of Lexington fight,
and here an Israelite among the Philistines. Rebel soldier,
just leaving for his regiment, shakes hands all round with
our men, who enjoin him to take care of himself. And how
soon these men may be putting daylight through each other!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
Note: I have experienced from rebel privates almost uniform
kindness, good-fellowship, <i>camaraderie</i>; they treat one
as fellow-soldier. And as for our men, they fraternize as
though the strawberry mark of brotherhood was on every
arm. All the insult, all the bitterness and ill-treatment, have
come from officers and citizens of high position in society,
and from the women, whose envenomed tongues are let loose
upon the wounded prisoner without mercy. This space
[referring to the space in the diary under the printed date of
Saturday, May 24] is the date of our midnight fight on the
dark road; and this [Sunday 25] of our fight and flight to
the Potomac, when hell broke loose in Winchester town;
and this Sunday is just such another, cool and bright; and
this morning [Monday, May 26] A, B, E, and K, were left
on picket at the fence and in woods, with a section of
Cothran, under Lieutenant Peabody. That was the work
that tried our souls. Ned and Dick, brave fellows, both
gone before. &ldquo;We a little longer wait, but how little who
can know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two men have died on this floor within the last twelve
hours,&mdash;the old man Carter with the consumption, and the
lieutenant with the typhoid, the former last night and the
latter just now. This afternoon [Wednesday, May 28], we
crossed the river; and how good camp was!</p>

<p><i>Monday, October 6.</i>&mdash;Got letters from home last night,
through Jim Savage, who still lives,&mdash;God be praised!&mdash;though
with one leg off, and a shattered shoulder. Add to
that that we are promised the parole of the yard; add to
that orders expected for Richmond in a few days. I&rsquo;ll bet
my knapsack will be packed when the assembly beats.
However, we&rsquo;ll not count this chicken before he chips the
shell, as old &mdash;&mdash; has tried to addle the egg all he could.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, October 7.</i>&mdash;One chicken incubated and made
his appearance. Hay, yesterday afternoon, in the intervals of
carving below (the hospital operating room was immediately
beneath us), sends up word that, if we will write out our
parole of the yard, he will sign it. And old &mdash;&mdash; not being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
on hand to botch the thing, I cooked up a document, got it
signed and sent down, to which the illustrious chief then
affixed his sign-manual, and we are henceforward free of
yard and grounds. Bully for that! [I remember now, I
was the first to test the document&rsquo;s efficacy, for we could
hardly believe that it would really pass us out. The guard
stopped me, of course, called the corporal, and finally
decided that it was a genuine thing; and I hobbled painfully
down four steep flights and out,&mdash;looked up and saw the
rest all crowding to the window and waving hands and hats
to see me actually emerge, like a rat, from the trap which
had held us through long weary months.] I find that the
art of crutch progression is quite a science, and has its outside
edges and its backward rolls, etc., which are not to
be learned without much practice and balancing. Up and
down stairs with ease, confidence, and grace, is somewhat
of an attainment.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 9th.</i>&mdash;Struggled out to pond and washed; first
decent wash for three months. Had to steal a piece of
black soap, and push out a board over the mud,&mdash;hard work
for a cripple. Stopped in at carpenter&rsquo;s shop and saw Dr.
Hay slice an arm off, <i>secundum artem</i>.</p>

<p><i>October 13.</i>&mdash;Suffering with the first cold snap. The
sergeant&rsquo;s wound keeps every window open, and we might
as well or better be <i>sub Jove frigido</i>. Rumors of small-pox
pervade the air.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 14th.</i>&mdash;An alarm of small-pox yesterday afternoon
in our ward turned out false, I believe, but has scared
everybody most out of their wits. It seems, however, there
were cases elsewhere; for, endeavoring to visit the pond
again, I was stopped by a guard, and told that some tents
just pitched by the shore contained the small-pox patients,
whom no one was allowed to approach within one hundred
yards. After they had recovered or died, the tents were set
on fire as they stood.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 15th.</i>&mdash;To-day, I followed Dr. Hay&rsquo;s trail all
day, bent on a personal interview, until I earthed him at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
last in his office; and the result is that we are off for Richmond
to-morrow. [I had seen the Richmond paper with the
official list of Yankees paroled from the Libby, among whom
were several whom I knew to be Pope&rsquo;s officers; and I determined
not to rot another day, as food for Confederate
vermin, without claiming my rights as prisoner of war. So
when, after repeated rebuffs, my obstinacy prevailed and
Hay gave orders to let me in, he wasn&rsquo;t in a good humor.
But I told him, I forget in what terms, that I had discovered
that I was no longer a hostage liable to be hanged in
retaliation for the execution of guerrillas, but a prisoner of
war, with all that that implied, and that, in behalf of all who
were able to travel, I demanded to be sent to the Libby.
He said we were better off where we were. I agreed, but
told him I would suffer anything to know that my name was
on the list to be paroled when my turn came, and that it
was my right to have it there. Finally he said, &ldquo;Will you
be ready to start before light to-morrow?&rdquo; &ldquo;Let me go
back for my blanket,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll start now.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;go back, and tell all who the ward surgeon says are
able, to be ready by half-past four.&rdquo; I saluted, faced about,
and was in the doorway when he stopped me and, seeming
to recover his temper, asked me and any of my friends who
could to come over to his office after supper and take a farewell
drink.] In the evening [the journal resumes], we attended
in Dr. Hay&rsquo;s office, to take a social drink. Hay
talked fire and fury, &ldquo;secesh&rdquo; running up as the whiskey ran
down. A lawyer and colonel joined in, and the telegram of
the Governor of North Carolina to the Governor of South
Carolina was so often quoted that I was fain to back down
from what was fast becoming a three-minute crowd. We
had an amputation to diversify the spree,&mdash;soldier brought
in, who I suspect had applied for a discharge by shooting off
two fingers of his right hand. They were badly mangled, so
Hay put him down on the floor and took them off again,
short metre, not without cutting his own in the operation,
he was so tight. I came away then, fearing that my crutches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
might not be as whiskey-proof as erst was wooden leg of
Sawin, and the descent of the front steps requiring that eye,
hand, and foot (literally, foot) should keep true time. There
wasn&rsquo;t much sleep in No. 7 that night, and early next
morning we were off, leaving George and the skeleton
sergeant, who is fast going down to the dead, though he
doesn&rsquo;t know it. We had an awful trip, being detained six
hours by a smash-up of the night before, killing seven and
wounding seventy-five,&mdash;a mere skirmish. Shortly before
we arrived, at about 1 A.M., an officer came through the car,
caught sight of my shoulder-straps, stopped: &ldquo;You are a
captain?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you got any federal greenbacks?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, a few.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I want some to pay a debt
I owe at the North, and I&rsquo;ll give you Confederate money for
them. You&rsquo;ll want some, for you&rsquo;ll probably lie for months
in the Libby, and you&rsquo;ll die if you don&rsquo;t send out and buy
good food.&rdquo; Said I, &ldquo;Thank you, I guess I&rsquo;ll hold on to my
greenbacks till I get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fact that nearly all the hospital officials had made the
same request on various pretexts was significant enough to
me. At 2 A.M., we arrived, where I now write, in the
Libby prison, being received with the once familiar cry of
&ldquo;Corporal of the Guard, Post No. 1.&rdquo; The corporal came
and let us in. The officer, cross and sleepy (the infernal
traitor, Peacock, by the way), sent us to the hospital department,
up three flights,&mdash;immense room in large tobacco
warehouse, lighted with a single dip, which only made darkness
visible. A ragged young nurse, with his hair on end,
welcomed us to the scene of despair. We were put on cots
of sacking, with nothing under or over us, and shivered ourselves
into oblivion. The next morning, the familiar notes
of reveille on the fife, accompanied by the bass and snare-drum
of the side-show, which Andrews used to detest so,
brought us again to consciousness. I was about to put my
head out of the window, but was forcibly informed that I&rsquo;d
better not, unless I wanted it shot off. This day, a party
went off which we had hoped to join, but were disappointed;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
and a squad of sixty odd came in from Macon, Georgia. I
thought that I had seen filth, squalor, and wretchedness
before, but I never even conceived the meaning of the
words; and what these men had been through would have
been incredible, except to those who saw them. They said
the Libby was heaven, in comparison to what they had
come from. Saw a dress-parade of the regiment on duty
here, which would have shamed the cadets for measliness
of turnout.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;In hell, <i>alias</i> the Libby prison.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;This morning before breakfast, little spitfire
clerk came up to take our paroles. I could have embraced
the little devil, but I didn&rsquo;t, only waited till my name was
called, when I toed the mark <i>instanter</i>, and quite won his
heart with the promptitude with which I recited my descriptive
list, insomuch that he asked me to take a letter
to his sweetheart. After this, the wretched crew were
packed into coaches and wagons, under command of the
black-hearted traitor Captain Peacock, and we left Libby,
the sergeant and I being in with two half-dead wretches of
the Macon crowd, swarming with vermin.</p>

<p>But after a miserable jolt of fifteen miles, our nigger driver
pointed out the boat lying in a distant bend. &ldquo;And dar de
flag,&rdquo; said he with a grin, &ldquo;ober de starn,&rdquo; indicating a small
red streak, which was &ldquo;the star-spangled banner, Oh, long
may it wa-a-ve,&rdquo; etc. I confess to embracing the staff when
I got aboard, and realized that Jeff. Davis himself couldn&rsquo;t
take me away without a fight. But before they let us go
aboard there was a long and to us incomprehensible delay
of nearly two hours, during which we lay on the grass just
above the landing and watched the boat, the flag, and the
blue uniforms, with longing eyes. [We learned afterward
that Captain Peacock, while strutting up and down the wharf
in full Confederate uniform, had been recognized by one of
the deck hands who had belonged to his former New York
regiment. The said deck hand pointed him out to a friend,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
with the remark, &ldquo;Look at his forehead, and you&rsquo;ll see traitor
written there.&rdquo; This being overheard by Mr. Peacock, he
demanded an apology for the insult, swearing that, if refused,
he would march us all back to the Libby. How they pacified
him I don&rsquo;t know, but at the end of two hours he had cooled
off enough to let us go aboard. I was the first who received
permission to go, whereat I bounced on to my one foot and
two crutches, picked up my blanket, and charged down the
hill. The rebel sentry, who hadn&rsquo;t yet got his orders to
pass us, charged bayonets on me for an instant, but, on a
sign from Peacock, shouldered arms again; and the next
moment I was embracing the flag-staff, as afore mentioned.
The Sanitary Commission received us with open arms and
some delicious milk-punch, and in a few minutes we were
under full steam out of rebeldom, Sergeant Holloway and
I leaning on the guards, watching the foam fly past, and
singing, <i>sotto voce</i>,&mdash;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going home, we&rsquo;re going
home, we&rsquo;re going home to die no more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were two days on board the flag-of-truce boat. The
next cot to mine was occupied by a man of a Massachusetts
regiment, taken at the first Bull Run. He was almost a
skeleton, and the worst case of chills and fever I ever saw.
The second day being a shake day, he couldn&rsquo;t eat his rations,
and offered them to me. He said he thought he was
dying. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t complain now I&rsquo;ve got out
of hell, and I shall live long enough to get back into God&rsquo;s
country and die there, which is all I&rsquo;ve been praying for for
months.&rdquo;]</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Aboard the &ldquo;Commodore,&rdquo; off Fortress Monroe,
waiting for orders, which have just come, for Washington.
And here we are at Washington, waiting orders again.
When I find myself once more a free man in Willard&rsquo;s
Hotel, I shall turn down the leaf of my experiences as
prisoner of war to the rebels.</p>

<p>Now for philosophy. Captain gone ashore, and fearful
rumors pervade the boat about Annapolis, New York, etc.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
Well, it can be but a day or two, and we are out of rebeldom.
I&rsquo;ve kept well so&mdash; [&ldquo;Far&rdquo; would have been the
next word, but marching orders intervened, and the next
entry, in big letters at the bottom of the page, reads] <span class="smcap">A
free man at Willard&rsquo;s</span>!</p>

<p>And the first act of the free man aforesaid was to purchase
some underclothes at the furnishing store, which
luckily had not closed for the night, and to proceed therewith
to the bath-room, where hot water and soap speedily
restored that self-respect which is so difficult to retain after
one is conscious of not being the only inhabitant of one&rsquo;s
garments. The next day, I drew my pay and replaced
my ragged blouse, bullet-pierced trowsers, and torn Confederate
cap (given me on the field to replace my broad-brimmed
felt, which a Georgia gentleman fancied), by the
jauntiest uniform clothes I could find, after which I sallied
out on the avenue; and the first man I met was the captain
of the &ldquo;Commodore,&rdquo; who at first insisted that I was mistaken,
as he had never seen me before in his life; and
only my crutches and wounded foot at last convinced him
that I was the same man who had talked to him about
Harry Russell, the day before. The next day, it was just
the other way. Smart young officer rushes up: &ldquo;Hallo,
Captain Quincy! thought it must be you. How are you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you thought it was I; but
whether it&rsquo;s you or not I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know, for I
should say I had never set eyes on you before.&rdquo; &ldquo;What,
you don&rsquo;t know the man you identified yesterday?&rdquo; And
it turned out to be a lieutenant of a Western regiment,
and fellow-prisoner, all of whose clothing in the Libby consisted
of shirt, trowsers, and army blanket pinned over his
shoulders. Arriving in Washington, without a cent, I had
identified him at the pay department, while still in his
blanket, from which chrysalis the all-potent greenback had
evoked as shiny a blue-and-brass butterfly as any on the
avenue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
This concludes my prison history. I was never again
taken, though coming pretty near it once or twice in Louisiana,
where, as an officer of colored troops, my experiences
might have been much more severe than those above recounted.
If the story has interested former comrades or
assisted in drawing closer the link which binds together the
survivors of the old regiment, I can only rejoice that the
committee asked me to relate it to you.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
